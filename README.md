#  Django CRM Site
This is a small project I made to learn how to use Django. You can add/delete "records" from a database and display the
records in a table. Each record includes text fields, an email field, the time the record was created, and an associated image. You can upload an image when making the record, otherwise, Django will use a "default.jpg" in the media folder. You can also update the records (including the images).

## Prerequisites
MySQL is the database engine used for this project. You can download it [here](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).

## Features
Implemented login, registration, adding in records with images and a "created at" timestamp, updating records + images, deleting records, and pagination for the record table.
